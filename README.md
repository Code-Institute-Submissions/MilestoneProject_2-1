## INTRODUCTION 

![Responsive image for game](assets/doc/responsive.png)

This project is a Star Wars themed memory match game. The game was constructed as a brain training tool 
to primarily strengthen memory whilst also being fun to play. It also has the option to change grid size 
depending on user preference to add another level of complexity. 

The game is more geared towards Star Wars fans and incorportes Star Wars themed images, audio and
facts with the intention of improving the overall playing experience.
